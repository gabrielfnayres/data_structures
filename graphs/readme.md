# Graph Application

This project is a simple implementation of graph operations using an adjacency list and adjacency matrix. It includes the following features:

- Loading a graph from a file
- Displaying the adjacency list and matrix
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Requirements

To compile and run the program, you will need:
- C++11 or later
- A working `make` installation

If you don't have `make` installed, follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.

## Execute the program
```
make
```

```
./graphs instncias_grafo/<instance>.txt
```
